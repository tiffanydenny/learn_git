# A Hello, World Website

This rudimentary website was me, playing around with Git. It is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial).

It includes a couple of links and animal photos, but is otherwise unremarkable. I did, however, learn some HTML, as well as how to navigate GitHub.

If you want to see it in all it's glory, visit the [*Live Site*] (tiffanydenny.github.io/website).
